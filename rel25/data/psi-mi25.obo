It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) \, which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed\, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell\, but it can also be carried out in other organism."

def: "Because of the long lifetimes of excited fluorescent molecules (nanoseconds)\, fluorescence can be used to monitor the rotational motion of molecules\, which occurs on this timescale. This is accomplished experimentally by excitation with plane-polarized light\, followed by measurement of the emission at parallel and perpendicular planes. Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule\, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group\, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal. Residue modification can be assessed by addition of an antibody which binds to the modified residue and alters the molecular weight of the complex. A variation of this technique has been used to show interaction of a DNA binding protein with another protein.  In this case the DNA rather than protein is fluorescently labelled."

The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle\, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection\, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa.

def: "This method permits the coupling of phenotype to genotype via the formation of a non-covalent ternary complex between mRNAs and their encoded polypeptides while they are translated in an in vitro system. As a first step a cDNA library is constructed that encodes chimeric proteins in which the natural proteins or protein domains are fused to a C-terminal tether. As a consequence when the mRNA is translated in vitro the domain can fold while the tether is still in the ribosomal tunnel. Furthermore this chimeric mRNAs lack a stop codon\, thus preventing release of the mRNA and the polypeptide from the ribosome. High concentrations of magnesium and low temperature further stabilise the ternary complex. Similarly to phage display\, these complexes can be used directly to select for nucleic acids encoding proteins with desired properties." [PMID:11551470, PMID for application instance:12167034]

def: "This approach leads to protein identification by combining mass measurement and short amino acid sequence information obtained by tandem mass spectrometry. This information is then used to automatically find the best match in a sequence database. A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides\, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis\, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum (\"Normal mass spectrum\" or \"Q1 mass spectrum\") gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set\, differing by one amino acid\, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein\, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest\, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases."

Macromolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the polymer surface\, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased protein mass retained on the polymer surface. Since all proteins have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and protein concentration near the surface\, this allows one to measure changes in protein concentration at the surface as a consequence of protein interaction. Furthermore\, this can be done in real time\, allowing direct measurement of both the on rate and the off rate of complex formation. " [PMID:12120258, PMID:11896282]

A fluorescence assay can also be carried out taking advantage of fMTX  binding to reconstituted DHFR. The basis of this assay is that complementary fragments of DHFR\, when expressed and reassembled in cells\, will bind with high affinity (Kd 5 540 pM) to fMTX in a 1\:1 complex. fMTX is retained in cells by this complex\, whereas the unbound fMTX is actively and rapidly transported out of the cells.

The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated\, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable protein crystals.

def: "This approach is based on the expression of peptides that bind to specific target proteins thereby interfering with their activity. In a standard approach the interfering peptide is expressed by genetic fusion to a stable protein scaffold. Interfering peptides can also be introduced into cells by fusing them to proteins or peptides (homeodomains\, Tat protein..) having the property of penetrating the cell membrane. The peptide-carrier fusion protein is either synthesized chemically or produced in vivo\, normally in bacteria. When the purified fusion protein is added to a cell culture\, it penetrates the cell membrane thereby permitting the fused peptide to interfere with its target protein."

The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing\, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing\, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the \"Tapped\" protein (first round of selection on the protein A\, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag).
