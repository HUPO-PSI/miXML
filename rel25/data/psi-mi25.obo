When this light passes through an optically active sample the two polarized components are absorbed differently. The difference in left and right handed absorbance A(l)- A(r) is the signal registered in CD spectra. This signal displays distinct features corresponding to different secondary structures present in peptides\, proteins and nucleic acids.

def: "The classical two-hybrid system is a method that uses transcriptional activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) \, which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed\, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell\, but it can also be carried out in other organism."

The key to this method is the use of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in which the deoxyribose 3'-OH group present in normal nucleotides is missing; when such a modified nucleotide is incorporated into a DNA chain\, it blocks the elongation of the chain. To determine the full sequence\, the four different chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleosides are used in competition with an excess of deoxyribonucleosides in separate DNA synthesis reactions on the same DNA template. When the products of these four reactions are analysed by electrophoresis in four parallel lanes of a denaturing polyacrylamide gel\, the DNA sequence can be derived. Every lane displays a family of DNA fragments of different lengths\, reflecting the different sites at which a specific residue occurs in the original DNA." [PMID:14755292]

A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle\, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection\, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS." [PMID:11785756]

It is consequently possible\, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR\, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact\: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the protein molecule.

The list of peptide masses obtained by MALDI MS is automatically compared to the calculated masses of the predicted peptide fragments for each entry in the database. High mass accuracy is very important in order to obtain a statistically significant and unambiguous match This method is best applied to completely sequenced genomes and well characterised proteomes. However\, depending on the data quality\, proteins that are highly homologous to already characterised proteins (greater than 80 to 90% sequence identity) can also be identified.

To prevent unwanted reactions involving the amino groups and carboxyl groups of the side chains during the coupling steps\, a protecting (blocking) group is attached to the side chains.

name: sequence tag: sequence tag identification
def: "This approach leads to protein identification by combining mass measurement and short amino acid sequence information obtained by tandem mass spectrometry. This information is then used to automatically find the best match in a sequence database. A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides\, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis\, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum (\"Normal mass spectrum\" or \"Q1 mass spectrum\") gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set\, differing by one amino acid\, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein\, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest\, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases."

def: "This method measures formation of complex by monitoring changes in the resonance angle of light impinging on a gold surface as a result of changes in the refractive index of the surface. A ligand of interest (peptide or protein) is immobilized on a dextran polymer\, and a solution of interacting protein is passed over it through a cell\, with a gold wall coated with this polymer. Macromolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the polymer surface\, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased protein mass retained on the polymer surface. Since all proteins have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and protein concentration near the surface\, this allows one to measure changes in protein concentration at the surface as a consequence of protein interaction. Furthermore\, this can be done in real time\, allowing direct measurement of both the on rate and the off rate of complex formation. " [PMID:12120258, PMID:11896282]

The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing\, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing\, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the \"Tapped\" protein (first round of selection on the protein A\, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag). \nOBSOLETE redundant term.

Two proteins or protein domains that are thought to bind to each other can then be fused to either of the two DHFR fragments. Reconstitution of enzyme activity can be monitored in vivo by cell survival in DHFR-negative cells grown in the absence of nucleotides. A fluorescence assay can also be carried out taking advantage of fMTX  binding to reconstituted DHFR. The basis of this assay is that complementary fragments of DHFR\, when expressed and reassembled in cells\, will bind with high affinity (Kd 5 540 pM) to fMTX in a 1\:1 complex. fMTX is retained in cells by this complex\, whereas the unbound fMTX is actively and rapidly transported out of the cells. Survival depends only on the number of molecules of DHFR reassembled. " [PMID:10318894]

The C-term fragment of ubiquitin is expressed as a fusion to a transcription factor that being linked to a membrane protein cannot perform its function unless it is released form the ubiquitin fusion by a specific protease. This achieved through the activity of UBP (an ubiquitin specific protease) that cleaves off the reporter protein only when a functional ubiquitin is reconstituted." [PMID:9560251]

def: "X-rays have a wavelength\, typically around 0.1 nm (the diameter of a hydrogen atom). If a narrow parallel beam of X-rays is directed at a sample of a pure protein\, most of the X-rays will pass straight through it. A small fraction\, however\, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal\, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated\, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable protein crystals. This requires high concentration of very pure protein and empirical searching for the proper crystallisation conditions." [PMID:14755292]

RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse\norganisms\, e.g.\, nematodes\, plants\, fungi\, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a processive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex\n(RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA\, the active RISC complex\nrecognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA. " [PMID:12408823, PMID:12110901]

The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing\, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing\, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the \"Tapped\" protein (first round of selection on the protein A\, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag).
