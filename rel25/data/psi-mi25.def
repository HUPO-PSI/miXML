term: adenylate cyclase: adenylate cyclase complementation
goid: MI:0014
definition: Adenylate cyclase is encoded by the cyaA gene and contains a catalytic domain which can be proteolytically cleaved into two complementary fragments, T25 and T18, which remain associated in the presence of calmodulin in a fully active ternary complex. In the absence of calmodulin, the mixture of the two fragments does not exhibit detectable activity, suggesting that the two fragments do not associate. When expressed in an adenylate cyclase-deficient E. coli strain (E. coli lacks calmodulin or calmodulin-related proteins), the T25 and T18 fragments fused to putative interacting proteins are brought into close association which result in cAMP synthesis. The level of reconstructed adenylate cyclase can be estimated by monitoring the expression of a cAMP dependent reporter gene.

term: bacterial display
goid: MI:0009
definition: The protein of interest is presented on the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria by expressing it as a fusion partner to peptide signals that direct heterologous proteins to the cell surface. For instance, a single chain Fv (scFv) antibody fragment, consisting of the variable heavy and variable light domains from two separate anti-digoxin monoclonal antibodies, was displayed on the outer membrane of Escherichia coli by fusing it to an Lpp-OmpA. Similar systems have also been developed for gram positive bacteria. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), is used to specifically select clones displaying a protein binding to scFv-producing cells.

term: beta galactosidase: beta galactosidase complementation
goid: MI:0010
definition: Beta-galactosidase activity can be used to monitor the interaction of chimeric proteins. Pairs of inactive beta gal deletion mutants are capable of complementing to restore activity when fused to interacting protein partners. Critical to the success of this system is the choice of two poorly complementing mutant moieties, since strongly complementing mutants spontaneously assemble and produce functional beta-gal activity detectable in absence of any fused protein fragment.

term: bn-page: blue native page
goid: MI:0276
definition: Blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) permits a high-resolution separation of multi-protein complexes under native conditions. Blue native (BN)-PAGE is a charge shift method, in which the electrophoretic mobility of a complex is determined by the negative charge of the bound Coomassie dye and the size and shape of the complex. Coomassie does not act as a detergent and preserves the structure of complexes. Importantly, the resolution of BN-PAGE is much higher than that of other methods such as gel filtration or sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. Combined with other pre-purifications or dialysis steps this method permits the analysis of multi-protein complexes of whole cellular lysates by BN-PAGE.

term: bret: bioluminescence resonance energy transfer
goid: MI:0012
definition: In this variation of the FRET assay the donor fluorophore is replaced by a luciferase (typically Renilla luciferase). In the presence of its substrate, the luciferase catalyses a bioluminescent reaction that excites the acceptor fluorophore through a resonance energy transfer mechanism. As with FRET the energy transfer occurs only if the protein fused to the luciferase and the one fused to the acceptor fluorophore are in close proximity (10-100 Angstrom)

term: cd: circular dichroism
goid: MI:0016
definition: Circular dichroism (CD) is observed when optically active molecules absorb left and right hand circularly polarized light slightly differently. Linearly polarized light can be viewed as a superposition of two components of circularly polarized light of equal amplitude and phase but opposite handness. When this light passes through an optically active sample the two polarized components are absorbed differently. The difference in left and right handed absorbance A(l)- A(r) is the signal registered in CD spectra. This signal displays distinct features corresponding to different secondary structures present in peptides, proteins and nucleic acids. The analysis of CD spectra can therefore yield valuable information about the secondary structure of biological macromolecules and the interactions among molecules that influence their structure.

term: ch-ip: chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
goid: MI:0402
definition: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a powerful approach that allows one to define the interaction of factors with specific chromosomal sites in living cells. ChIP involves treating cells or tissue briefly with formaldehyde to crosslink proteins to DNA. An antibody against a protein suspected of binding a given cis-element is then used to immunoprecipitate chromatin fragments. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of the immunoprecipitate with primers flanking the cis-element reveals whether a specific DNA sequence is recovered in an immune-specific manner and therefore whether the protein contacted the site in living cells.

term: chip-chip: chromatin immunoprecipitation array
goid: MI:0225
definition: The method combines a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) procedure, with DNA microarray analysis. Cells are fixed with formaldehyde, harvested, and disrupted by sonication. The DNA fragments cross-linked to a protein of interest are enriched by immunoprecipitation with a specific antibody. After reversal of the cross-links, the enriched DNA is amplified and labeled with a fluorescent dye (Cy5) by using a ligation-mediatedpolymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR). In parallel a sample of DNA that is not enriched by immunoprecipitation is subjected to LM-PCR in the presence of a different fluorophore (Cy3), and both immunoprecipitation (IP)-enriched and unenriched pools of labeled DNA were hybridized to a single DNA microarray containing a set of intergenic sequences. The ratio of the Cy5 to Cy3 fluorescence intensities measured at each DNA element in the microarray provided a measure of the extent of binding of the transcription factor to the corresponding genomic locus

term: chromatography: chromatography technologies
goid: MI:0091
definition: Used to separate and/or analyse complex mixtures. The components to be separated are distributed between two phases: a stationary phase (bed) and a mobile phase which percolates through the stationary bed. The nature of the two phases determines the separation criteria exploited by the column  such as affinity, ionic charges, size or hydrophobicity of the molecules under analysis. Each type of column can be implemented with the mobile phase  under atmospheric or high pressure condition. In this later case columns are designated as High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).

goid: MI:0021
definition: Two proteins can be localised to cell compartments, in the same experiment, if they are expressed as chimeric proteins fused to distinct proteins fluorescing at different wavelengths (Green Fluorescent Protein and Red Fluorescent Protein for example). Using a confocal microscope the two proteins can be visualized in living cells and it can be determined whether they have the same subcellular location. Fluorescence microscopy of cells expressing a GFP fusion protein can also demonstrate dynamic processes such as its translocation from one subcellular compartment to another.

term: dhfr reconstruction: dihydrofolate reductase reconstruction
goid: MI:0111
definition: The gene for DHFR is rationally dissected into two fragments called F[1,2] and F[3]. Two proteins or protein domains that are thought to bind to each other can then be fused to either of the two DHFR fragments. Reconstitution of enzyme activity can be monitored in vivo by cell survival in DHFR-negative cells grown in the absence of nucleotides. A fluorescence assay can also be carried out taking advantage of fMTX  binding to reconstituted DHFR. The basis of this assay is that complementary fragments of DHFR, when expressed and reassembled in cells, will bind with high affinity (Kd 5 540 pM) to fMTX in a 1:1 complex. fMTX is retained in cells by this complex, whereas the unbound fMTX is actively and rapidly transported out of the cells. Survival depends only on the number of molecules of DHFR reassembled.

The resulting domain profiles are then used to screen the proteome of another organism and domain-domain interactions are inferred. Ultimately, an inferred protein interaction map is built in this second organism.

term: elisa: enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
goid: MI:0411
definition: Following non-covalent binding of a purified primary ligand to a solid phase, a blocking reagent is added to prevent any non-specific binding. A specific antigen is then allowed to bind to the primary ligand. Unbound antigen is removed by washing and a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme (e.g. horseradish peroxidase) is added. Following a washing step to remove unbound secondary ligand, the extent to which a chromogenic substrate (e.g. 3,3', 5,5' tetramethyl benzidine chromogen [TMB]) is converted to a soluble coloured product by the conjugated enzyme in a given time is determined by spectrophotometry using a standard microplate absorbance reader. A similar type of approach can be utilized to detect enzymatic activities. The substrate, attached to a solid phase is incubated in the presence of the enzyme and the enzymatic modification is monitored by an antibody that is specific for the modified substrate (for instance a phosphorylated protein).

term: epr: electron paramagnetic resonance
goid: MI:0042
definition: EPR (also called ESR, Electron Spin Resonance) spectroscopy is analogous to NMR, but is based on the excitation of unpaired electrons instead of nuclei. Unpaired (single) electrons are only found in radicals and some metal ions (paramagnetic species); the EPR spectrum provides information about the environment and mobility of the paramagnetic species. The magnetic interaction of two paramagnetic centres in a protein can be used to calculate the distance between them; this allows studies of the movements and interactions of protein segments. In proteins without any intrinsic unpaired electrons it is possible to attach a radical probe (spin label). Stable nitroxide radicals can be bound to amino acid residues, in analogy with fluorescent probes. In combination with site directed mutagenesis this method is used in particular to study structure and assembly of membrane proteins, by measuring with EPR whether an amino acid is in a polar or non polar environment.

term: far western blotting
goid: MI:0047
definition: Proteins are fractionated by PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and tested for the ability to bind to a protein, a peptide, or any other ligand. Cell lysates can also be fractionated before gel electrophoresis to increase the sensitivity of the method for detecting interactions with rare proteins. Denaturants are removed during the blotting procedure, which allows many proteins to recover (or partially recover) activity. However, if biological activity is not recoverable, the proteins can be fractionated by a non denaturing gel system. This variation of the method eliminates the problem of activity regeneration and allows the detection of binding when the presence of a protein complex is required for binding. The protein probe can be prepared by any one of several procedures, while fusion affinity tags greatly facilitate purification. Synthesis in E. coli with a GST fusion, epitope tag, or other affinity tag is most commonly used. The protein of interest can then be radioactively labelled, biotinylated, or used in the blotting procedure as an unlabeled probe that is detected by a specific antibody.

As a consequence, any increase in the mass of a biomolecule, e.g. as a result of an interaction with a second molecule, is readily detected as an increase in the diffusion time of the particle. From these results the concentration of the different molecules can be calculated as well as their binding constant.

definition: Filamentous phages (M13, f1, fd) have been extensively used to develop and implement the technology of phage display. Repertoires of relatively short peptides of random amino acid sequences or cDNA libraries have been constructed and searched successfully. Most experiments have taken advantage of the ability to assemble phages decorated with hybrid versions of the receptor protein pIII or of the major coat protein pVIII. Both systems allow the display of foreign peptides by fusion to the amino-terminus of the capsid protein but differ in the number of peptide copies that can be displayed on each phage particle. Display libraries of very diverse protein fragments have been constructed by fusing either genomic or cDNA fragments to gene III or gene VIII.

term: filter binding
goid: MI:0049
definition: Proteins expressed by different clones of an expression library are bound to a nitrocellulose membrane, by colony (bacterial library) or plaque (phage library) blotting. A labelled protein can then be used as a probe to identify clones expressing proteins that interact with the probe. Interactions occur on nitrocellulose filters. The method is highly general and therefore widely applicable, in that proteins as diverse as transcription factors and growth factor receptors have been successfully used as probes. A variety of approaches can be used to label the protein ligand, alternatively the ligand can be detected by a specific antibody.

term: fingerprinting: peptide massfingerprinting
goid: MI:0082
definition: This approach leads to protein identification by matching peptide masses, as measured by mass spectrometry, to the ones calculated from in silico fragmentation of a protein sequence database. A peptide mixture from a tryptic digest is analysed by MALDI-MS (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry). The list of peptide masses obtained by MALDI MS is automatically compared to the calculated masses of the predicted peptide fragments for each entry in the database. High mass accuracy is very important in order to obtain a statistically significant and unambiguous match This method is best applied to completely sequenced genomes and well characterised proteomes. However, depending on the data quality, proteins that are highly homologous to already characterised proteins (greater than 80 to 90% sequence identity) can also be identified. The retrieved sequence are evaluated by mass accuracy of the peptides, matching of additional peptide masses in the MALDI spectrum after accounting for common modifications such as oxidation, acrylamidation of cysteine and missed cleavages and the use of secondary information (apparent isoelectric point and molecular weight). If any ambiguity about the identification by MALDI-MS still exists, the results must verified by an other identification method. Peptide mass fingerprint is generally carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) instrument but can also be achieved ESI-TOF (Electrospray Ionisation time-of-flight) or LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) mass spectrometer.

term: fluorescence spectr: classical fluorescence spectroscopy
goid: MI:0017
definition: Proteins contain endogenous fluorophores such as tryptophan residue and heme or flavins groups. Protein folding and protein-protein interaction can be studied by monitoring changes in the tryptophan environment detected by changes in its intrinsic fluorescence. Changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum on complex formation can occur either due to a shift in the wavelength of maximum fluorescence emission or by a shift in fluorescence intensity caused by the mixing of two proteins. The interaction of two proteins causes a shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum relative to the sum of the individual fluorescence spectra, resulting in a difference spectrum [F (complex)-2 F (sum)], which is a measurable effect of the interaction. Loss of fluorescence signal from a substrate can be used to measure protein cleavage.

term: fps: fluorescence polarization spectroscopy
goid: MI:0053
definition: Because of the long lifetimes of excited fluorescent molecules (nanoseconds), fluorescence can be used to monitor the rotational motion of molecules, which occurs on this timescale. This is accomplished experimentally by excitation with plane-polarized light, followed by measurement of the emission at parallel and perpendicular planes. Since rotational correlation times depend on the size of the molecule, this method can be used to measure the binding of two proteins because the observed polarization increase when a larger complex is formed. A fluorescence anisotropy experiment is normally carried out with a protein bearing a covalently added fluorescent group, which increases both the observed fluorescence lifetime of the excited state and the intensity of the fluorescent signal. Residue modification can be assessed by addition of an antibody which binds to the modified residue and alters the molecular weight of the complex. A variation of this technique has been used to show interaction of a DNA binding protein with another protein.  In this case the DNA rather than protein is fluorescently labelled.

term: fret: fluorescent resonance energy transfer
goid: MI:0055
definition: FRET is a quantum mechanical process involving the radiationless transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to an appropriately positioned acceptor fluorophore. The fluorophores are genetically fused to the protein in analysis and cotransfected. Three basic conditions must be fulfilled for FRET to occur between a donor molecule and acceptor molecule. First, the donor emission spectrum must significantly overlap the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. Second, the distance between the donor and acceptor fluorophores must fall within the range 0.002 to 0.01 10-6m. Third, the donor and acceptor fluorophores must be in favourable orientations.

term: full dna sequence: full identification by sequencing
goid: MI:0056
definition: sequencing occurs during the course of the experiment.\nThe DNA to be sequenced is used as template for the in vitro synthesis, by DNA polymerase, of a set of partial replicas, all beginning at the same place, but terminating at different points along the DNA chain. The key to this method is the use of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates in which the deoxyribose 3'-OH group present in normal nucleotides is missing; when such a modified nucleotide is incorporated into a DNA chain, it blocks the elongation of the chain. To determine the full sequence, the four different chain-terminating dideoxyribonucleosides are used in competition with an excess of deoxyribonucleosides in separate DNA synthesis reactions on the same DNA template. When the products of these four reactions are analysed by electrophoresis in four parallel lanes of a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, the DNA sequence can be derived. Every lane displays a family of DNA fragments of different lengths, reflecting the different sites at which a specific residue occurs in the original DNA.

The discovery of LexA DNA binding domains that bind to different DNA sequence enabled the development of this system.

term: ion exchange chrom: ion exchange chromatography
goid: MI:0226
definition: Stable complexes and their component proteins can be separated on the basis of their net charge by ion-exchange chromatography. If a protein has a net positive charge at pH 7, it will usually bind to a column of beads containing carboxylate groups, and can then be eluted by increasing the concentration of sodium chloride or another salt in the eluting buffer by competition of sodium ions with positively charged groups on the protein for binding to the column. Protein that have a low density of net positive charge will tend to emerge first, followed by those having a higher charge density. Positively charged complexes or proteins (cationic proteins) can be separated on negatively charged carboxymethyl-cellulose (CM-cellulose) columns. Conversely, negatively charged complexes or proteins (anionic proteins) can be separated by chromatography on positively charged diethylaminoethyl-cellulose (DEAE-cellulose) columns.

term: itc: isothermal titration calorimetry
goid: MI:0065
definition: Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measures directly the energy associated with a chemical reaction triggered by the mixing of two components. A typical ITC experiment is carried out by the stepwise addition of one of the reactants (~10-6 L per injection) into the reaction cell (~1mL) containing the second reactant. The chemical reaction occurring after each injection either releases or absorbs heat (qi) proportional to the amount of ligand that binds to the protein with a characteristic binding enthalpy (DH). As modern ITC instruments operate on the heat compensation principle, the instrumental response (measured signal) is the amount of power (microcalories per second) necessary to maintain constant the temperature difference between the reaction and the reference cells. Because the amount of uncomplexed protein available progressively decreases after each successive injection, the magnitude of the peaks becomes progressively smaller until complete saturation is achieved. The difference between the concentration of bound ligand in the ith and (i-1)th injections depends on the binding constant Ka and the total ligand injected. The calculations depend on the binding model (number of substrates). Analysis of the data yields DH and DG = -RTlnKa. The entropy change is obtained by using the standard thermodynamic expression DG = DH-TDS.

term: modified residue ms: mass detection of residue modification
goid: MI:0068
definition: Mass spectrometry can be used to characterise chemical modifications within peptides. One approach consists in the observation of a mass difference when a sample is treated with an enzyme that can specifically remove a peptide modification, for instance a phosphatase. The mass difference corresponds to the mass of the chemical group covalently linked to a residue. Such experiments carried out with a MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight ) do not allow the mapping of the modification site within the sequence, whereas any tandem mass spectrometer (LC MS/MS Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry, nanoESI MS/MS nanoElectrospray Ionisation tandem mass spectrometry, FTMS Fourier Transform mass spectrometry) provide such information. A second approach consists of the direct mass measurement of the ionized chemical group dissociated from the residue within a tandem mass spectrometer. Both approaches need a prior enrichment of the modified peptide population in the samples with IMAC (Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography)or specific anti-modification antibodies.

definition: In sizing columns (gel filtration), the elution position of a protein or of a complex depends on its Stokes radius. Molecules with a radius that is smaller than the bead size are retained and retarded by the interaction with the matrix. The observation that two proteins, loaded on a sieving column, elute in a fraction(s) corresponding to a MW that is larger than the MW of either protein may be taken as an indication that the two proteins interact. Furthermore this technique provides a conceptually simple method for evaluating the affinity of the interaction.

term: mrna display
goid: MI:0073
definition: This method relies on the covalent coupling of mRNA to the nascent polypeptide. The mRNA (natural or artificial) is first covalently linked to a short DNA linker carrying a puromycin moiety. The mRNA mixture is then translated in vitro. When the ribosome reaches the RNA-DNA junction the ribosome stalls and the puromycin moiety enters the peptidyltransferase site of the ribosome and forms a covalent linkage to the nascent polypeptide. As a result the protein and the mRNA are covalently joined and can be isolated from the ribosome and purified. In the current protocol, a cDNA strand is then synthesised to form a less sticky RNA-DNA hybrid and these complexes are finally used for affinity selection. As in most display approaches, several selections cycles (3-6) are sufficient to enrich for mRNAs encoding ligand proteins.

term: ms of complexes: mass spectrometry studies of complexes
goid: MI:0069
definition: Mass spectrometric approaches to the study of protein in complexes permits the identification of subunit stoichiometry and transient associations. By preserving complexes intact in the mass spectrometer, mass measurement can be used for monitoring changes in different experimental conditions, or to investigate how variations of collision energy affect their dissociation. Complexes can be transferred into the gas phase by a nanoflow ESI (Electrospray Ionisation) ionisation device. This is the method of choice for the investigation of the higher-order structure of biomolecules because it allows direct analysis of dilute aqueous solutions and the desolvation process is efficient and closer to the native-like solution environment. Mass measurements of intact macromolecular complexes is largely the domain of time of-flight (TOF) MS. This is mostly due to the high sensitivity and speed of TOF analysis, as well as the virtually unlimited m/z range. Quadrupole TOF (Q-TOF) type mass spectrometers combine a quadrupole mass filter with an orthogonal TOF analyser. These spectrometers provide supplementary structural information for ions isolated in the quadrupole and analysed in the TOF. This allows complexes well in excess of 60 kDa to be dissociated and consequently their subunit composition can be determined.

definition: The strategy to determine the complete amino acid sequence of a protein by mass spectrometry relies on the generation of a nested set of fragments differing by one amino acid. This permits to reveal the identity of the residue that has been removed at each degradation step by measuring the mass difference of fragments differing of one residue. Peptide fragments can be obtained by protease treatment combined with the fragmentation promoted by collision (or other methods) within a tandem mass spectrometer. This approach can be carried out with LC MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry), nanoESI MS/MS (nanoElectrospray Ionisation tandem mass spectrometry), or FTMS (Fourier Transform mass spectrometry) instruments.

goid: MI:0077
definition: NMR requires a small volume of concentrated protein solution that is placed in a strong magnetic field. Certain atomic nuclei, and in particular hydrogen, have a magnetic moment or spin; that is, they have an intrinsic magnetisation, like a bar magnet. The spin aligns along the strong magnetic field, but can be changed to a misaligned excited state in response to applied radio frequency (RF) pulses of electromagnetic radiation. When the excited hydrogen nuclei relax to their aligned state, they emit RF radiation, which can be measured and displayed as a spectrum. The nature of the emitted radiation depends on the environment of each hydrogen nucleus, and if one nucleus is excited, it will influence the absorption and emission of radiation by other nuclei that lie close to it. It is consequently possible, by an ingenious elaboration of the basic NMR technique known as two-dimensional NMR, to distinguish the signals from hydrogen nuclei in different amino acid residues and to identify and measure the small shifts in these signals that occur when these hydrogen nuclei lie close enough to interact: the size of such a shift reveals the distance between the interacting pair of hydrogen atoms. In this way NMR can give information about the distances between the parts of the protein molecule. NMR provides information about interacting atoms thereby permitting to obtain information about protein structure and protein-protein interaction.

term: peptide synthesis
goid: MI:0083
definition: When one of the partners participates in the interaction with a relatively short peptide fragment, it is often convenient to precisely identify the minimal region that supports the interaction by synthesising a series of overlapping peptides and by testing them in the binding assay. Synthetic peptides that are identical with peptides synthesised in vivo are useful experimental tools for such studies. Peptides are routinely synthesised in a test tube from monomeric amino acids by condensation reactions that form peptide bonds. Peptides are constructed sequentially by coupling the C-terminus of a monomeric amino acid to the N-terminus of the growing peptide. To prevent unwanted reactions involving the amino groups and carboxyl groups of the side chains during the coupling steps, a protecting (blocking) group is attached to the side chains. Without these protecting groups, branched peptides would be generated. In the last steps of synthesis, the side chain-protecting groups are removed and the peptide is cleaved from the resin on which synthesis occurs.

definition: This approach is based on the expression of peptides that bind to specific target proteins thereby interfering with their activity. In a standard approach the interfering peptide is expressed by genetic fusion to a stable protein scaffold. Interfering peptides can also be introduced into cells by fusing them to proteins or peptides (homeodomains, Tat protein..) having the property of penetrating the cell membrane. The peptide-carrier fusion protein is either synthesized chemically or produced in vivo, normally in bacteria. When the purified fusion protein is added to a cell culture, it penetrates the cell membrane thereby permitting the fused peptide to interfere with its target protein.

goid: MI:0084
definition: Peptide sequences or entire proteins can be displayed on phage capsids by fusion to coat proteins to generate a library of fusion phages each displaying a different peptide. Such a library can then be exploited to identify specific phages that display peptides that bind to any given bait molecule for instance an antibody. The selection is performed by a series of cycles of affinity purification known as panning. The bait protein, immobilized on a solid support (plastic, agarose, sepharose, magnetic beads...) is soaked in the phage mixture and that phage that remains attached to the bait is amplified and carried through a further affinity purification step. Each cycle results in an approximately 1,000-fold enrichment of specific phage and after a few selection rounds (2-4), DNA sequencing of the tight-binding phage reveals only a small number of sequences. Phage display panning experiments can be carried out either on libraries of peptides of random amino acid sequence or on libraries of displaying natural peptides obtained by inserting cDNA fragments into the phage vector (cDNA libraries). Libraries have been assembled on several different phages (Fd, Lambda or T7).

goid: MI:0098
definition: This method permits the coupling of phenotype to genotype via the formation of a non-covalent ternary complex between mRNAs and their encoded polypeptides while they are translated in an in vitro system. As a first step a cDNA library is constructed that encodes chimeric proteins in which the natural proteins or protein domains are fused to a C-terminal tether. As a consequence when the mRNA is translated in vitro the domain can fold while the tether is still in the ribosomal tunnel. Furthermore this chimeric mRNAs lack a stop codon, thus preventing release of the mRNA and the polypeptide from the ribosome. High concentrations of magnesium and low temperature further stabilise the ternary complex. Similarly to phage display, these complexes can be used directly to select for nucleic acids encoding proteins with desired properties.

definition: RNA interference (RNAi) is a post-translational gene silencing method reproducing a naturally occurring phenomena. RNAi is the process whereby double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) induces the sequence-specific degradation of homologous mRNA. RNAi or dsRNA-induced silencing phenomena are present in evolutionarily diverse\norganisms, e.g., nematodes, plants, fungi, and trypanosomes. The mechanisms by which RNAi works is initiated by a processive cleavage of dsRNA into 21 to 23 nucleotide (nt) short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These native siRNA duplexes are then incorporated into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex\n(RISC). ATP-dependent unwinding of the siRNA duplex generates an active RISC complex. Guided by the antisense strand of siRNA, the active RISC complex\nrecognizes and cleaves the corresponding mRNA.

Fremont, CA, USA) for sample fractionation accomplished by retentate chromatography. Retentate chromatography is performed on ProteinChip Arrays with varying chromatographic properties (e.g. anion exchange, cation exchange, metal affinity and reverse phase). By utilising arrays with differing surface chemistries in parallel and in series, a complex mixture of proteins, as from cells or body fluids, can be resolved into subsets of proteins with common properties. Specific analytes can also be examined by using preactivated arrays to which a bait molecule (such as an antibody or biotinylated DNA) is immobilized and a solution containing the binding partner(s) is presented to the array. This array-based immunoprecipitation or protein-binding experiment has been used with good success to study DNA-binding proteins, receptor-ligand interactions, and protein complexes. Any ligand retained on a SELDI chip can directly be identified by mass spectrometry.

term: sequence tag: sequence tag identification
goid: MI:0102
definition: This approach leads to protein identification by combining mass measurement and short amino acid sequence information obtained by tandem mass spectrometry. This information is then used to automatically find the best match in a sequence database. A mixture of peptides derived from a protease digestion is analysed by nanoelectrospray LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometer or nanoESI MS/MS) mass spectrometry. Electrospray mass spectrometry cannot be applied to dilute samples and is affected by high salt. As a consequence peptides, normally extracted from acrylamide gels by in situ proteolysis, are desalted and concentrated on a microcolumn followed by elution into a capillary used for nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. A first mass spectrum ("Normal mass spectrum" or "Q1 mass spectrum") gives information about the masses of all the peptides. Peptides observed in the normal mass spectrum are isolated in turn and dissociated into fragments by collision with gas molecules within the mass spectrometer. Some of the fragments obtained from a peptide constitute a nested set, differing by one amino acid, and the mass difference between them allows assignment of a partial sequence. The masses of the fragments define the position of the partial sequence in the peptide. Together with the cleavage specificity of the protease used to cleave the protein, and mass information such sequence tag provides much higher search specificity to match the a database entry. The procedure is repeated with several peptides from the digest, resulting in multiple identifications of the same protein or identification of several proteins from the peptide mixture. Unknown proteins can easily be identified by using the high specificity of the peptide sequence tag for searches in most sequence databases including EST or genome databases.

definition: SPA relies upon the fact that a beta particle emitted from a radioisotope decay can excite a fluorophore only when it is at a very short distance in water solution (few micrometers). The ligand is labelled with a radioactive atom and its potential partner is fixed to fluorophore containing beads, the emitted fluorescence proving their interaction can be measured in a scintillation counter. The scintillator measures only the amount of bound radiolabelled ligand. Competition experiment with cold competitor can be done to estimate the binding affinities (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], cold ligand versus labelled ligand). Loss of signal can also be used to measure substrate cleavage by an enzyme, and labelled antibodies used to titrate the degree of modified residue present.

term: spr: surface plasmon resonance
goid: MI:0107
definition: This method measures formation of complex by monitoring changes in the resonance angle of light impinging on a gold surface as a result of changes in the refractive index of the surface. A ligand of interest (peptide or protein) is immobilized on a dextran polymer, and a solution of interacting protein is passed over it through a cell, with a gold wall coated with this polymer. Macromolecules that interact with the immobilized ligand are retained on the polymer surface, and alter the resonance angle of impinging light as a result of the change in refractive index brought about by the increased protein mass retained on the polymer surface. Since all proteins have the same refractive index and since there is a linear correlation between resonance angle shift and protein concentration near the surface, this allows one to measure changes in protein concentration at the surface as a consequence of protein interaction. Furthermore, this can be done in real time, allowing direct measurement of both the on rate and the off rate of complex formation.

term: tap tagged
goid: MI:0524
definition: The TAP method involves the fusion of the TAP tag (encoding a calmodulin binding peptide, a TEV cleavage site, and the Staphylococcus aureus Protein A) to the target protein and the introduction of the construct into the host cell or organism, maintaining the expression of the fusion protein at, or close to, its natural level. The fusion protein and associated components are recovered from cell extracts by affinity selection on an IgG matrix. After washing, the TEV protease is added to release the bound material. The eluate is incubated with calmodulin-coated beads in the presence of calcium. This second affinity step is required to remove the TEV protease as well as traces of contaminants remaining after the first affinity selection. After washing, the bound material is released with EGTA. This two steps purification steps ensures a highly selective complex purification of the "Tapped" protein (first round of selection on the protein A, a high affinity tag) under mild condition (non denaturant pH or conditions required to remove the tag).

Association of the two TM results in the ToxR-mediated activation of a reporter gene such as CAT (chloroamphenicol acetyltransferase activity). The level of CAT expression indicates the strength of TM association. CAT expression can then be tested and quantify by measuring CAM resistance with disk diffusion assay or CAT activity assays on cell-free extracts.

term: two hybrid
goid: MI:0018
definition: The classical two-hybrid system is a method that uses transcriptional activity as a measure of protein-protein interaction. It relies on the modular nature of many site-specific transcriptional activators (GAL 4) , which consist of a DNA-binding domain and a transcriptional activation domain. The DNA-binding domain serves to target the activator to the specific genes that will be expressed, and the activation domain contacts other proteins of the transcriptional machinery to enable transcription to occur. The two-hybrid system is based on the observation that the two domains of the activator need to be non-covalently brought together by the interaction of any two proteins. The application of this system requires the expression of two hybrid. Generally this assay is performed in yeast cell, but it can also be carried out in other organism.

term: two hybrid array
goid: MI:0397
definition: Two-hybrid screening can be done in a colony array format, in which each colony expresses a defined pair of proteins. Because the particular protein pair expressed in each colony is defined by its position in the array, positive signals identify interacting proteins without further characterization, thus obviating the need for DNA purification and sequencing. The interrogation of a two-hybrid colony array usually involves a mating strategy in which every DNA binding domain hybrid (the bait) is tested against all activation domain hybrids (the preys) in a grid pattern. Arrays usually use full-length open reading frames.\n\n

term: ub reconstruction: ubiquitin reconstruction
goid: MI:0112
definition: In this method the two proteins, whose interaction is under investigation, (in this case mostly membrane proteins) are fused to an terminal fragment (Nub) and to a C-terminal fragment of ubiquitin (Cub). The two fragments do not associate to form a functional ubiquitin unless the two fused membrane proteins form a complex. The association is monitored by an ingenious trick. The C-term fragment of ubiquitin is expressed as a fusion to a transcription factor that being linked to a membrane protein cannot perform its function unless it is released form the ubiquitin fusion by a specific protease. This achieved through the activity of UBP (an ubiquitin specific protease) that cleaves off the reporter protein only when a functional ubiquitin is reconstituted.

term: x-ray: x-ray crystallography
goid: MI:0114
definition: X-rays have a wavelength, typically around 0.1 nm (the diameter of a hydrogen atom). If a narrow parallel beam of X-rays is directed at a sample of a pure protein, most of the X-rays will pass straight through it. A small fraction, however, will be scattered by the atoms in the sample. If the sample is a well-ordered crystal, the scattered waves will reinforce one another at certain points and will appear as diffraction spots when the X-rays are recorded by a suitable detector. The position and intensity of each spot in the X-ray diffraction pattern contain information about the position and nature of the atoms in the crystal. The three-dimensional structure of a large molecule can be deduced from the electron-density map of its crystal. In recent years X-ray diffraction analysis has become increasingly automated, and now the slowest step is likely to be the production of suitable protein crystals. This requires high concentration of very pure protein and empirical searching for the proper crystallisation conditions.
