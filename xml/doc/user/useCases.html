<h1><a name="actors">Actors</a></h1>
<h2>Database</h2>
<p> A Database of molecular interactions stores relations between
proteins, DNA and other molecules. </p>
<h2>Database 2</h2>
<p> Same as Database </p>
<h2>Database Publisher</h2>
<p> A Database Publisher maintains and distributes a database of
molecular interactions. </p>
<h2>High-throughput Data Producer</h2>
<p> A High-throughput Data Producer uses large-scale techniques such as
systematic screens to produce interaction data in large quantities. </p>
<p> A High-throughput Data Producer works in a large structure and is
assumed to benefit from a laboratory information management system
(LIMS) with standardized operating procedures and quality assurance
methods, as well as from the presence of bioinformatics support staff. </p>
<h2>Curator</h2>
<p> A Curator reviews, verifies and edits data in a database in order to
improve the quality of the information that is made available to data
consumers. </p>
<h2>Biologist</h2>
<p> A Biologist consults a database to extract data in a useful form for
his or her scientific activity. The can happen as soon as the data are
deposited in the database (and once any embargo is lifted), and need not
wait for formal publication of the results in a peer-reviewed journal. </p>
<h2>Investigator</h2>
<p> An Investigator is an individual researcher (and his or her research
team), who uses small-scale techniques to analyze interactions of
proteins of interest. </p>
<p> An Investigator works in a small, independant structure, without
necessarily benefiting from a laboratory information system (LIMS) or
bioinformatics support personnel. Data will most often be initially
created using ad hoc tools such as spreadsheets. </p>
<h2>Journal Publisher</h2>
<p> A Journal Publisher receives submitted articles, verifies that the
associated interaction data was indeed submitted to a public Database,
and transmits the article to the Reviewer for evaluation. </p>
<h2>Reviewer</h2>
<p> A Reviewer evaluates an article for a Journal Publisher. This
evaluation may include consultation of the submitted experimental data. </p>

<h1><a name="usecases1">Use Case 1</a> - peer-to-peer data exchange</h1>
<img src="PSI-MI.uc1.gif" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 519px; height: 312px;">&nbsp;
<h2>Describe DB</h2>
<p> Describe source database, so that importers understand how we
(Database Publisher) use the PSI-MI format to represent our data. </p>
<h2>Import data</h2>
<p> Database Publisher imports data from Database 2, interpreting PSI-MI
records according to his understanding of the use of PSI-MI by Database
2. </p>
<h2>Export data</h2>
<p> We (Database Publisher) export data from Database. Note that there
is no association to Database 2 or its Database Publisher, since we
don't know who will do the importing or indeed that it will be imported
anywhere at all. </p>

<h1><a name="usecases2">Use Cases 2</a> - data submission and curation</h1>
<img src="PSI-MI.uc2.gif" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 711px; height: 472px;">
<h2>Submit data</h2>
<p> The Investigator submits finished data sets to the database using
the PSI-MI format. </p>
<h2>Describe Experiment</h2>
<p> In order to provide a conforming submission, the Investigator must
describe the experimental procedure and the kind of interactions that
were detected, using appropriate controlled vocabularies. </p>
<h2>Create PSI</h2>
<p> The Investigator creates an initial PSI-format file, typically from
a CSV-formatted spreadsheet file. This initial PSI file need not be
canonical, we anticipate that only "interaction" records will be
present. Tools must be provided to convert this initial, minimal, PSI
file to canonical form. </p>
<h2>Merge PSI</h2>
<p> An Investigator can generate separate PSI files, one for each
spreadsheet. Tools must be provided to merge these files into a
coherent, submittable PSI file. </p>
<h2>Complete PSI</h2>
<p> Initial PSI files do not necessarily contain all the information
related to the experiments, interators, and interactions that are needed
for submittable PSI files. The Investigator completes the information in
the initial file, using tools for manipulating PSI data. </p>
<h2>Curate data</h2>
<p> Curation involves modifying records, adding or deleting parts of the
record; merging database records to produce nonredundant data sources;
and deleting records that are judged to be false or inaccurate. This
curation may use standalone tools using PSI-MI as an interchange format,
or database-specific tools. In both cases PSI concepts and controlled
vocabularies should be used. </p>
<h2>Query database</h2>
<p> In extracting data from databases, Investigators, Biologists and
other data consumers formulate queries. These queries should use PSI-MI
concepts and controlled vocabularies. </p>
<hr>
<h1><a name="usecases3">Use Cases 3</a> - formal publication</h1>
<img src="PSI-MI.uc3.gif" title="" alt=""
 style="width: 537px; height: 376px;">
<h2>Receive ticket</h2>
<p> An Investigator submits his or her experimental data to a Database,
and receives a deposit ticket that justifies that the data were indeed
received. </p>
<h2>Verify ticket</h2>
<p> A Journal Publisher verifies that the data associated with an
article under consideration for publication were indeed deposited, by
querying the Database with the deposit ticket that the Investigator
provides. </p>
<h2>Submit article</h2>
<p> An Investigator submits an article to a Journal Publisher for
consideration, and supplies the deposit ticket that permits the Journal
Publisher to verify that the associated experimental data were indeed
deposited. </p>
<h2>Extract data</h2>
<p> Investigators, Biologists and other data consumers can extract data
in PSI-MI format from databases. </p>
<p> Extraction for Reviewers should be allowed even when the data are
under embargo pending publication. </p>
