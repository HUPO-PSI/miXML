<h2>Introduction</h2>
The Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) aims to define community standards for data representation in proteomics to
facilitate data comparision, exchange and verification.<P>
The Proteomics Standards Initiative was founded at the HUPO meeting in Washington, April 28-29, 2002 (see <a
 href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/296/5569/827?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;searchid=1027414274815_1591&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;volume=296&amp;firstpage=827&amp;fdate=10/1/1995&amp;tdate=7/31/2002">Science
296, 827</a>). As a first step, the PSI is developing standards for two key areas of proteomics:
<a href="http://psidev.sourceforge.net#ms">mass spectrometry</a> and <a href="http://psidev.sourceforge.net#ppi">protein-protein interaction</a> data.
<P>
This document decribes the protein-protein interaction data exchange format.  PSI is following a leveled approach to building this specification.
Level 1 will describe protein interactions at a basic level that covers a large amount of currently available data.  Subsequent levels will add
capability to represent new protein interaction information that the community wishes to exchange.
<P>
The scope of PSI PI is currently only protein-protein interactions.  Other molecules, such as small molecules, DNA and RNA
may be taken into account in the future.
<P>
PSI PI was designed by a group of people including representatives from database providers and users in both academia and industry.
PSI PI is expected to be supported by the DIP, MINT, IntAct and BIND databases.
<P>

<h2>Purpose of this document</h2>
The purpose of this document is to describe the PSI protein interaction specification in a more user-friendly manner than the
specification does itself.  The specification contains XML Schema annotation and is the most up-to-date reference.<p>

<h2>Outline of a PSI PI record</h2>
<img src="MIF_Entry.png"><BR>
Insert user-friendly documentation and rationale behind decisions here.

<h2>Use of external controlled vocabularies</h2>
Where possible, external controlled vocabularies have been referenced from PSI PI.  Specifically controlled vocabularies have
been used to describe:<BR>
<ul>
<li>Protein interaction determining experimental methods (from IntAct)
<li>Protein identification experimental methods (from IntAct)
<li>Protein function (from Gene Ontology 'molecular function' and 'biological process' ontologies)
</ul>

<h2>Detailed description of PSI PI</h2>
-Probably best to point to the XMLSpy generated docs here.<BR>
-Detailed description of all fields (use XML documentation as a base and XML Spy pictures as figures)<BR>

<h2>List of planned features</h2>
Because we are following a leveled approach, we are interested in knowing what the community
wishes to be included in the next level.<P>
The following items have been tagged for inclusion in the next level:
<ul>
<li>Intramolecular interactions
</ul>
<br>
The latest list of features to include in the future can be found here:
