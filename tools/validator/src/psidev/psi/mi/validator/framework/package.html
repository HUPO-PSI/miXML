This package contains the generic framework of the validator.
<br/>
That framework is meant to be customized to the user/schema needs.
<br/>
The major components are:
<pre>
    <b>Rule</b> : contain the logic of a single Validation rule. That (abstract) class cannot be used as is and need
           to be extended.
    <b>Validator</b>: this is a container for a set of rules and we delegate to it the responsability to run these
               rules against the XML document to validate. In return, a Collection of validation messages
               (ValidatorMessage) are returned.
    <b>ValidatorMessage</b>: a message generated by a Rule. A rule can set a description, a log level as well as Tips
                      on how to fix that error.
    <b>Context</b>: this qualifies where the error occured. If well set, that will give useful information to the user
                    to track where the error occur in the XML document.
    <b>MessageLevel</b>: Log4J-like error level management consisting of 5 categories described below
                     * The DEBUG Level designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to
                       debug an application.
                     * The INFO level designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the
                       application at coarse-grained level.
                     * The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.
                     * The ERROR level designates error events that might still allow the application to
                       continue running.
                     * The FATAL level designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the
                       application to abort.
                  These levels are hierarchical: FATAL > ERROR > WARN > INFO > DEBUG
