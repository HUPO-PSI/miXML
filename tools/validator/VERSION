What's new
==========

[Validator]

    - Added a short description of the software (doc/readme.html)
    - Added SAX Validation against Schema
      This is done before semantic validation. Should it fails, the validation process stops.
    - Loading of ontology via HTTP (a URL can be specified in the validator configuration)
    - Caching of Ontology loaded via HTTP on hard drive
    - API for handling User preferences
    - Add UserPreferences to Validator
        - it contains the user directory by default for temp files
        - it can be overriden
        - take out 'last directory opened' and make it specific to the gui
          though it uses user preference from the validator to find where is the temp directory.
        - set is the SAX validation has to be done

[GUI]

    - Added Menu bar ( Some unix user seem not to be able to use the D7D feature :( )
        - Open file to validate
        - Memorize last directory opened
        - Help section
            - display current version of the validator

TODOs
=====

[Validator]

    - Integrate expand/conpact stylesheet (with possibility for the user to disable the feature )
      The pipeline becomes: expand input file > SAX validation > semantic validation.

[GUI]

    - Add Option panel to:
       - allow to disable SAX validation
       - set time delay before ontology cache gets cleared

    - Additional menus:
        - messages: allowing filtering, clearing of the message list.
        - log level: allowing to change the log level without restarting the application.
