  <td><h1>XML Maker tutorial: how to create your PSI file</h1></td>
</table>


<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to is to lead you step by step
through the creation of a the PSI XML file describing protein interactions 
according to the PSI format.</p>


<ol>
<li>
<h2>Open a schema</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is to load the PSI schema. This file is called MIF.xsd and 
is available at the <a href="http://psidev.sourceforge.net/">PSI</a> web page. 
You can also find it in the directory called data.
Once the schema is loaded, the root node should be displayed in the main frame. It 
is named entrySet and is colored in <font color="red">red</font>, indicating that 
something is missing (that's not
a surprise, since do not have done any mapping yet).
</p>
</li>
  
<li>
<h2>Set defaults values</h2>
<h3>Set your prefix</h3>
<p>By pressing the button <b>set your prefix</b>, you can enter a prefix value that describes
 your institute
(e.g. EBI, MINT...). This value will be used later if you want the application to generate 
automatically some values, usually used as ids.</p>
<h3>Associate first fields to default values:</h3>
<p>We click for the first time on the node entrySet. This node is now extended and contains two attributes 
(<b>level</b> and <b>version</b>), and an element 
named entry.</p>
<p><i> After the name of this element we can read <b>max: unbounded</b>; it means 
that there is no limitation in the number of elements contained in an entrySet.
 In our case, we just 
need one that will contain all our data.</i></p>

<p>We can already give a default value to the attributes <b>level</b> and <b>version</b>.
After selecting the node level by clicking on it, 
we set the radio button <b>association to default value</b>, and press the button <b>Associate</b>
. A window 
is opened where we can enter the value for this field (in our case it should be <b>1</b>).
We can do it again for the attribute <b>version</b> (with the value <b>1</b>).</p>

<p>Now we care ready to process.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Open a file</h2>
<p>
We can open the flat file that contains the description of the interaction. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>line separator:</b> by default, it is assumed that each line describes the data about one 
interaction. We can change it by specifying a line separator. For exemple 
it can be the double character <b>//</b>.</li>
<li><b>first line for title:</b> if the first line of the flat file contains the titles for the 
columns, we have to check this box. If we do not do it, the final XML file will contain
an element which data will be the titles.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Associate the file to a node</h2>
<p>Now that the flat file describing the interactions is loaded, we have to tell to the 
application to what node the file has to be mapped. The flat file describes a list of interactions
(an interaction on each line) so we can map it to the element <b>interactionList</b> (entrySet, entry,
 interactionList). In order to do it we select the node interactionList, select the radio button
 <b>association to flat file</b> and click on <b>Associat</b>e.</p>
 <p>Once the file associated to a node, the tab that displays this file takes
 the name of the node associated (interactionList).</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Choose the separator (for the flat file)</h2>
<p>By default, no separator is selected, so a whole line of the flat file is displayed 
in a cell from the list. So we can click on choose the separator and type the one we want to use.
For example if the separator is <b>|</b>, we can write <b>\|</b> (see the documentation for more about the 
regular expressions), if the separator is <b>;</b> we write <b>;</b> and if it can be <b>;</b>
 , or <b>:</b> we write <b>;|,|:</b>.
The line has now been splited and each field is displayed in a cell.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Do the mapping</h2>
<p>It is now time to do the mapping beetween the flat file and the schema. I will just 
give some examples of what can be done.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>short label:</b> if the first field/cell contains a label for the interaction, 
we select the cell,
select the node shortLabel (click on interaction to expand this node, then on names, and 
on shortLabel), we choose the radio button <b>association to field</b> and click on 
<b>associate</b>. 
The node shortLabel is now displayed in black; it means that the node has been mapped.
If an error message is displayed, it probably means that we have forgotten to associate the flat
file to a node.</li>  

<li><b>Interactors:</b> there are two ways to add interactors to the interaction, 
the <b>normalize</b> one, 
and the <b>unnormalized</b> one.
<ul>
<li><b>unnormalize</b>: an interaction contains the whole description of its components, 
including 
the description of the proteins. So we can click on <b>proteinParticipant</b>. As it is 
expanded, we 
can see a node named <b>(proteinInteractorRef|proteinInteractor)</b>. It means that we have
 to choose 
between <b>proteinInteractorRef</b> or <b>proteinInteractor</b>. As we want an 
<b>unnormalized</b> file, we click
on it and choose <b>proteinInteractor</b>. The element <b>proteinInteractor</b> is expanded 
and we can do
the mapping of the protein.
</li>  
<li><b>normalize</b>: an interaction contains only a reference to its interactors. 
The whole description
of those interactors is contained in the interactorList of the element entry, and should be mapped
from another file. We choose <b>proteinInteractorRef</b>, and do the mapping 
to the <b>attribute ref</b> and the field that contains the reference to an interactor.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The minimum amount of interactors necessary is two, so by default two proteinInteractor are 
displayed. If some interactions involve more than two proteins, we can select the node 
proteinInteractor and click on <b>duplicate</b>. A new node proteinInteractor will be 
created. This
operation can be repeated as long as the maximum number of this element is not
reached (as the number of proteinInterator is unbounded, we can do it as many time as we want).</i></p>
</li>

<li><b>PSI attributes</b>: mapping with a node that is not found in PSI, for example we have a field 
named username 
that contains the name of the user who has added the interaction. So we have to add a new 
<b>attribute</b>
in the <b>attributeList:</b> click on interaction, attributeList, attribute.
The name of this new 
attribute is username so we select the node, select the radio button <b>association to default
 value</b>
and click on <b>associate</b>. When requested, we enter the string username. Now we can select 
the
cell containing the username, the node named attribute, the radio button association to a field
and click on <b>associate</b>.
</li>

<li><b>splitting a cell:</b> we want to fill the element <b>positionInterval</b> in the 
feature <b>location </b>
of the <b>proteinParticipant</b> (interaction, participantList, featureList, location, 
choice of 
positionInterval). This element contains two attributes <b>begin and end</b>, but in our 
flat file
we only have a field that contains this value formated as <b>begin-end</b>. We can manage it 
by splitting the cell: we click ont the button <b>see next line</b> until such a cell is 
displayed (because it is not possible with the title),
we select this cell and click on <b>split cell</b>. A new list is displayed, which contains only
one cell filled with the data from the cell that had been selected. As we have done for the
main list, we choose a <b>separator</b>: <b>-</b>, and the list is now a list of two cells.
 We can do the
mapping between the first cell and the node <b>begin</b>, the second one and the node <b>end</b>
, and click
on <b>back to parent list</b> to return to the main list. The same process could have 
been done to
a cell of the sublist. The same mapping is kept for each line of the flat file.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Other files</h2>
<p>We can do it again with <b>other flat files</b>. If we choosed to do a mapping of normalized 
interactions,
we are supposed to map another flat file to the <b>interactorList</b>. In that case we click on 
<b>add tab</b>, a new tab is created that can be selected by clicking on it 
(it doesn't have any name at this time as we do not have associated it to a node, whereas 
the first one is called 
interactionList, as the node it is associated to). Once selected, we can choose a file, 
associate it to the node <b>interactorList</b>, and continue with the choice of a
 separator and
the mapping as we have done with the interactions.</p>
<p>The same process can be repeated, for example for a list of experiments.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Checkings:</h2>
<p>Once all the mappings done, there should not be anymore red elements, it means that the minimum mapping is 
done. At any moment we can click on <b>check</b> and a new window will display all errors or warnings 
found. We can also select a node and click on <b>about the node</b> to have some information 
about it, 
or select a node and click on <b>preview</b>, a window will display the XML code that would 
be generated
for this node if data is taken in the lines currently displayed from the flat file.</p>
</li>

<li>
<h2>Print</h2>
<p>It is almost over, it remains to click on <b>print</b> and choose the name of the file to print, and the name
of the file where will be printed errors and warning messages.</p>
</li>
