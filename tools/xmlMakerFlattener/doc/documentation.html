	<li><h3><a name="Description">Description</a></h3>
		<p>XML Maker and XML Flattener are two applications that allow to convert tab delimited files to XML documents and XML documents to tabdelimited files according to an XML schema.</p>

		<p>Both application can be used either with or without graphical interface. The graphical interface allows to load an XML schema and to create a mapping between 
		flat (tab delimited) files and XML document. Once a mapping has been created, it can be reused directly on the command line.</p>

		<h4>Flattener:</h4>
		<p>To create a mapping file, an XML schema should first be loaded in the GUI . A graphical tree representation of this schema is then created. 
		On this tree it is possible first to choose the 'main node', i.e. the node that contains all information that will be displayed on a single 
		line of the output tab-delimited file. Then it is possible to select the elements and attributes that will be exported.
		The application will automaticaly calculate the number of columns necessary according to the number of sub-elements found.</p>

		<h4>Maker:</h4>
		<p>To create a mapping file, an XML schema should first be loaded in the GUI, then one (or more) flat file. A graphical tree representation of this schema is created. 
		On this tree it is possible first to associate a node to a flat file. An element corresponding to this node will be created in the output XML document 
		for each line of the flat file. At this point the fields of the file can be associated to the nodes of the schema.</p>
		<p>Other types of associations are possible:
		<ul><li><b>to default value:</b> specify the value that will be always associated to this node, whatever the flat files contains</li>
			<li><b>to automatic value:</b> a unique value will be automaticaly generated</li>
			<li><b>to dictionary:</b> a dictionary is a tab delimited file that contains synonyms of terms. It is possible to associate a node to which has already been 
			assigned a value (association to field, default value), to a dictionnary. When a synonym is found, it will be replace by its main value.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Both applications have been develop on and required a <b>Java 1.4</b> environment (or newer) (<a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp">http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a>).</p>

  <h4>The menubar</h4>
  <h5><b>File</b></h5>

  <li><b>About</b>: it provides information about the software</li>
  </ul></li>

<li>  <h3><a name="maker">The maker: from flat file to XML</a></h3>
  <p>The window is divided into 3 parts:
  <ul>  
  <li>The flat files panel</li>
  <li>The dictionnary panel</li>
  <li>The schema panel</li>
  </ul></p>
<ol>

<li>  <h4><a name="flatfile">The flat files panel</a></h4>
  <p>This panel displays the flat files that have been opened. It is possible to
  open more than one file by creating a new tab and then opening a file.</p>
  
  <ul>
  	<li><b>Add a tab:</b> creates a new tab where another flat file can be opened.</li>
    <li><b>Open a file:</b> opens a flat file and displays its first line in a list. If no separator
	has been yet selected, the whole line will be written in the first cell. When choosing 
	the file, it is possible to:
	<ul>
      <li><b>specify a separator for the line</b>: by default the lines in the flat file 
	  are readed
	  one by one. It is, however, possible to define a line separator, lines will then be read until 
	  the separator is found. As a consequence the lines are defined by the separator.</li>
	  <li><b>Skip the first line:</b> the first line of a flat 
	  file often contains the titles of the columns. This feature is particularly useful, in the context of this 
	  application, as the column titles will be displayed in the cells and will make easier the mapping to the tree.
	  In this case you should check the box ‘first line for titles’ in order to prompt the application to ignore
	  this line when writing the XML document.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Choose the field separator:</b> chooses the separator that is used to split the fields in the flat file
	lines.
	 The separator must be provided  as a regular expression.</li>
	Going through the file:
	<li>You can ask to display the <b>next line</b> or to go <b>back to the first one</b>.</li>
	<b>Splitting a field:</b> Splitting the lines in the flat file into fields, by defining a field 
	separator wisth a regular expression,is sufficient for most purposes. It is sometimes useful, 
	however, to split the information that is contained in a single field in the flat file. To this 
	end the XML maker application permits to select a column and split it into a sublist.. Also in 
	this case separators are defined with regual expressions.
	<ul>
      <li><b>Split cell:</b> creates a new sublist by splitting (according to a defined separator) 
	  the values from the cells in the column defined by the selected cell. Alternatively. If the 
	  cell had already been split, it displays the corresponding sublist </li>
	  <li><b>Back to the parent list:</b> displays the parent list (the one that owns the cell that
	  has been split into current list).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul></li>
  
 <li> <h4><a name="dictionnary">The panel for dictionnary (replacement values)</a></h4>
  <p>The dictionnary panel is used to load a file that associates values in 
  the flat file to a new set of values. The dictionnary can be used to replace values in the flat file 
  with the new corresponding values, as defined in the dictionnary file.</p>
  <h5>Structure of a dictionnary:</h5>
  <p>A dictionnary file contains on each line a first word
  (the key)  followed by a list of other words (the replacement values). Each word is separate from the 
  others by a separator that can be specified while loading the file. A dictionnary
  can be loaded from a flat file, a tab delimited file...</p>
  <p>an example: <br>
  Delition|deletion analysis|MI:0033<br>
  Mutation|mutation analysis|MI:0074</p>
  <p>The dictionnary tool can be used, for instance to replace values by an identifier,
  for example, in the case of PSI, the species names by their taxId.
  This dictionnary would be loaded from a file in which each line contains
  a name and an identifier.
  <p>When associating a node to a dictionnary, the user will the choice to replace 
  the values from the associated field in the flat file with the values in the second or in the 
  third column of the dictionnary. When a dictionnary does not find a
  value, it behaves as if the field were empty.</p>
  </li>



<li>    <h4>The schema panel</h4>
  <h5>The tree</h5>
  <p>The main frame displays a tree that represents the loaded XML schema. 
  Two different icons are used to represent an <b>attribute</b> <img src="../images/ic-att.gif" border=0> 
  or an <b>element</b> <img src="../images/ic-elt.gif" border=0>. Text colors in node names give some 
  indications about the association status of the nodes: 
  <ul>
  <li><b><font color="gray">grey: </font>(no association)</b> is the default color</li> 
  <li><b><font color="red">red: </font> (error or warning)</b> indicates that something 
  is wrong or missing. 
  It could mean for example that an element that is mandatory according to the schema has 
  not been associated 
  to any field in the flat file or default value, or that a  children element is missing.</li>
  <li><b><font color="black">black: </font> (association)</b> the node has been mapped, 
  i.e. it is associated to   a field, or to a default value. Alternatively a value may be 
  automatically generated for this element. </li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>The node names also provide  some information. They take the form <b>name (type, max: maxOccur)</b> 
  where name is the <b>name</b> of the element or attribute, type is the XML type and <b>maxOccurs</b> the maximum
  amount of this element allowed by the schema (only for elements).</p>
  <p>When a <b>choice</b> is possible, (for instance beetwen an element description and an element reference),
  it is displayed as <b>(choice1|choice2|choice3...)</b>.
  When clicked, this type of node opens a window that allows to select  an element.</p>
  
  <h5>The button panel</h5>
  The schema:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Open a schema:</b> loads an XML schema and displays a tree representation</li>
	<li><b>Set your prefix:</b> you can choose a prefix that will be used as prefix 
	for each <a href="#autogenerated">value generated</a> by the XML maker when you request it.</li>
	<li><b>Check:</b> checks whether any  association or element is missing and displays 
	errors and warning messages.</li>
  </ul>
  The node:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Duplicate:</b> creates a new node identical to the selected node and with the same parent.
	It has no effect if the node is not supposed to 
	be duplicated (for attributes, or if the maximum amount allowed by the schema is already
	reached: for example if a node "basketball team" contains already five nodes "player on the field", 
	a sixth "player on the field" would not be allowed).</li>
	<li><b>About the node:</b> provides some information about the node such as its type and 
	associations.</li>
  </ul>
  The associations:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Target of the association</b> the ’associate’ and ‘cancel associations’ buttons 
	allow to establish or cancel an association.          
	A set of radio buttons permits to indicate the item type that one wants to associate: 
	<ul>
     <li><b>to flat file:</b> specifies that the <a href="#flatfile">flat file</a> selected in the flat file
	  panel has a content 
	 that can be described by the selected node. Such an association should be done to a node 
	 containing a list, and each line of the flat file is described by an element of the list. For example,
	 if the flat file describes a list of interactions, this file would have to be associated
	 to a node that contains a list of interactions.</li> 
	 <li><b>to field: </b>the association will be made between the node selected on the tree and the field selected
	 in the <a href="#flatfile">flat file panel</a>. When writing the XML document, the XML maker will look in
	 this field to find the value for the element.</li>
	 <li><b>to dictionnary:</b> associates <a href="#dictionnary">the dictionnary</a>
	 selected in the dictionnary panel to the node 
	 selected on the tree. When writing the XML document, the XML maker will look in the flat file 
	 for terms that are defined in the dictionary and substitute them (in the associated XML element) 
	 with the corresponding values as defined in the dictionary. If the term in the flat file is not defined 
	 in the dictionary, no value will be present in the XML file. </li>
	 <li><b>to default value:</b> associates a value to the node. A window is opened that allows to type 
	 this value. When writing the XML document, the XML maker will always set the element
	 or the attribute described by the node to this value.</li>
	 <li><b><a name="autogenerated">to automatic value</a>:</b> a unique value will be genererated 
	 each time the XML maker will try to marshall the selected node selected. The value will look like 
	 "prefix-number" where prefix can be changed by clicking on the button <i>set your prefix</i> and number 
	 is a number incremented each time such a value is generated. It can be used for example to 
	 generate an identifier.</li>
    </ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Associate:</b> makes the association according to the checked radio button checked. An association 
	of type field, default value or generated value will delete any previous association of one
	of those types to the same node.</li>
	<li><b>Cancel:</b> it cancels  an association (of the type selected by the radio button) 
	to the selected node. </li>
  </ul>
  The output:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Preview:</b> opens a window displaying an overview of the XML code that will be generated
	for the selected nodeusing the values of the current lines in the flat files.</li>
	<li><b>Print:</b> creates the XML document.</li>
  </ul></li>
  
  
  

</ol>
</li>




 
 <li> <h3><a name="flattener">The flattener: from XML to flat file</a></h3>
  <p>The “flattener” applicationwas developed  to give the opportunity to organize 
  a subset of the elements of an XML document in a flat file. The flattener can 
  reckon the number of columns  that are needed to represent the information in the 
  XML document. For example, if an element named list can contain, according to the XML schema,
   an amount unbounded 
  of another element called child, the ‘flattener’ will first check in every list for 
  the maximum number of child elements
  (and <a href="#refs">references</a> to this type of element) and The output flat file will 
  then contain  have on each line the appropriate
  amount of fields (even empty) (example: for a node describing an interaction, if each interaction
  in the XML documents are interactions between two proteins, but one is an interaction 
  between three proteins, each line in the flat file will have the number of fields 
  necessary to describe three interactors.</p>
  
  <h4>The tree</h4>
  <p>The main frame displays a tree that describes the loaded XML schema. 
  The icon code is the same as used for the XML maker.
  The colors are used as described here:
  <ul>
  <li><b><font color="gray">grey: </font>(default)</b> is the default color</li> 
  <li><b><font color="red">red: </font> (error or warning)</b> indicates that the node in the 
  XML document is assumed to contain a value ,according to the schema.</li>
  <li><b><font color="black">black: </font> (association)</b> the node has been selected to 
  appear in the final flat file.</li>
  <li><b><font color="blue">blue: </font> (main node)</b> the node represents a line in the 
  flat file. For example for an element interactionList containing interation elements, we would 
  select the element interaction and each line in the output  will describe an interaction. 
  If no node has been manually selected to represent a line in the flat file, the flattener chooses 
  automatically the last node that contains every selected nodes.</li> 
  </ul></p>
  <p>When, according to the schema, a <b>choice</b> is possible it is displayed as 
  <b>(choice1|choice2|choice3...)</b>.
  When clicked, all possible choices are expanded, offering the possibility to get each of them
  in the flat file (if the same choice is not made for each element in the XML document).</p>
  
  <h4>The button panel</h4>
  The schema:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Open a schema:</b> loads an XML schema and displays its tree representation.</li>
	<li><b>Open an XML document:</b> loads an XML document and displays a preview of the title
	line that will be produced for the flat file. The preview is empty if no document has been
	loaded yet.</li>
	<li><b>Node describing a line:</b> when pressed, the node selected will be considered as 
	the node describing a line of the flat file.</li>
  </ul>
  The node:
  <ul>
	<li><b>About the node:</b> gives some information about the node.</li>
  </ul>
  The associations:
  <ul>
	<li><b>Select this node:</b> the values for the element represented by the selected node 
	will appear in the flat file.</li>
	<li><b>Unselect the node:</b> it reverse the selection.</li>
  </ul>
  The output:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Choose the separator:</b> open a window that gives the possibility to choose the 
	field separator in the flat file.</li>
	<li><b>Print the flat file:</b> creates the flat file.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>About the references and the behaviour of the flattener:</h4>
<p>When the flattener encounters an element of type "refType", it behaves as if it had 
encountered the element the “refType” is referring to. Thus when an element is selected, the flat file 
will contain all those elements and all those that are referenced.	
</p>
</li>
</ol> 


</li> 
  
  <li><h2><a name="regexp">Regular Expressions</a></h2>
  <p>Lot of documentation about regular expressions can be found on the web. I will
  give here only some basic rules and examples of regular expressions that could be used 
  to define the separators.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><u>single character</u>: such as <b>;</b> or <b>,</b> or <b>.</b>. The line will be split 
	when the character is encountered.</li>
  <li><u>the vertical bar "|"</u>: is a <b>boolean operator</b>. It means that the separator can
  be either the character before or the character after the vertical bar (e.g.: ;|,|. the line will be
  split each time a ".", a "," or a ";" will be encountered).</li> 
	<li><u>special characters</u>: like "|". Such a caracter has a meaning in a regular expression
	so it has to be protected if we want to use it as a separator. The protection is made by using 
	the caracter"\".
	For using the separator "|" we would have to write <b>\|</b>.</li>
	<li><u>code for tabulation</u>: <b>\</b>t	</li>
	<li><u>code for new line</u>:<b>\n</b>>/li>
  </ul>
 
  </li>
